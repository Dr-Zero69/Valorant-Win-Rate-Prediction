Valorant Win Rate Prediction
üìå Overview

This project predicts match outcome (win vs. loss) in Valorant using player performance features (KD, kills, deaths, assists) plus categorical context (agent, map). The original continuous win rate was converted to a binary target using a 0.5 threshold:

win = 1 if win_rate ‚â• 0.5

win = 0 otherwise

The workflow covers EDA ‚Üí preprocessing ‚Üí baseline Logistic Regression ‚Üí hyperparameter tuning ‚Üí evaluation.

üîë Features

EDA: frequency plots (agents, maps), histograms, correlation matrix

Preprocessing: encoding categorical features (Agent Name, map_name), handling types

Models: Base Logistic Regression vs. tuned Logistic Regression

Evaluation: accuracy (train/test), side-by-side bar chart comparison

‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Run

Clone the repo and install the libraries listed below (no requirements.txt needed):

git clone https://github.com/Dr-Zero69/Valorant-Win-Rate-Prediction.git
cd Valorant-Win-Rate-Prediction

# (optional but recommended) create a virtual env
python -m venv .venv
# mac/linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# windows (powershell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# install dependencies
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter


Launch the notebook:

jupyter notebook Valorant_data_prediction_hyper_parameter.ipynb

üì¶ Dependencies

Python 3.x

numpy, pandas

matplotlib, seaborn

scikit-learn

jupyter

(If you later prefer a requirements.txt, you can add one with the same list.)

üß™ Data & Target

Target: binary win label derived from win_rate using 0.5 threshold

Predictors: KD, Kills, Deaths, Assists, Agent Name, map_name (and any others present)

Notes: KD is related to Kills/Deaths; keep an eye on multicollinearity for linear models. Trees are less sensitive.

Results

Base Logistic Regression (test): 64.35% accuracy

Tuned Logistic Regression (test): 67.57% accuracy

The tuned model outperforms the base model on both train and test sets (see bar chart in the notebook).

Repro Tips

Ensure categorical encoding happens after splitting (or use pipelines) to avoid leakage.

If classes are imbalanced, report additional metrics (precision/recall, F1, ROC AUC) and/or use class weights.

Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome‚Äîfeel free to suggest features (e.g., tree models, cross-validation, confusion matrix in README).

Optional: .gitignore

Create a .gitignore to keep the repo clean:

.ipynb_checkpoints/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.venv/
.env
